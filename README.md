### Overview
The general idea is that Wayfair has an amount per employee that they are spending on snacks.  We love this, and would like to greater influence over the items bought with this money in a democratic fashion.

This is a fun project to examine how internal HR and Wellness initiatives can gain from concepts and technologies in the blockchain world.

### User Story
Mark has had a few ideas on how to improve the review proccess here at Wayfair.  He doesn't feel it's a big enough deal to actually surface to HR but thinks it is valuable nonetheless.  He also loves the carrots and hummas at work.

One afternoon Mark goes to get carrots from the kitchen but they are all out.  He sees there are plenty of other choices, and loves that Wayfair provides all kinds of carb based choices like crackers and chips, but wishes he had more vegieteable choices.

As he's about to leave back to his desk, only a tiny bit disapointed he sees a sign prompting for feedback on the snacks.  He scans the QR code, simply selects that he'd rather have his small portion of money go towards vegitables or even a specific vegitable over a specific type of chip -- because he likes the rice chips.  He continues to scroll to the next question that is required in order to submit the snack preference and it asks for general feedback about Wayfair, to which he gives his feedback that he previously was not going to say anything about.
