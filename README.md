# ASSA
Autonomous Synergistic Synchronicity Association
Tasked with pushing forward human consciousness and awareness.
© 2019  - John D. Storey

## Assumptions
The initial funds, courses and audience needed to start are made available to us.  We’ll assume a modest sum of a $10,946 endowment, 377 Guided Meditation audio files, and 13 paid courses that already exist in the ecosystem.

Roles appointed to members rely on random selection at the moment of need from the entire pool of eligible users, in essence forming a type of Jury Duty to help protect and serve the org.

All numbers, ratios and amounts in the examples below should be viewed as variables.  Subject to change.  Ideally being able to be adjusted dynamically by the group as the org grows and faces new challenges.

We will never be able to stop bad actors fully.  At the end of the day, it’s a system of humans and they can be threatened, bullied or bribed off-chain.  We accept this vulnerability the same way we accept the risk of existing in the world.  For this reason the role of citizenship officer is very important.

There is a mechanism for attaching identities to users making civil attacks by bots hard to achieve.  A user could hypothetically have multiple accounts, but we hope through AI assistance of comparing photos to spot these duplicate accounts.

The persons that initially start this group will not immediately decentralize it.  In order to move quickly and prove out different hypothesis the product will be built on a web 2.0 stack until the ecosystem is mature enough to support itself, at which point the persons will work on decentralizing the tech stack and all associated responsibilities.

## Definitions
*POC*: proof of consciousness

*Insight*: a tweet sized text -- to be expanded to audio/video when applicable

*Meditation*: an audio file meant to be consumed during meditation.  Free to submit, but if want to enter into competition to win, then needs to have a stake of $1 or corresponding voice tokens placed on it.

*Pool*: where all insights and respectively meditations go in order to be selected by peers.

*Peer Insight Selection*: Groups of 5 insights are placed next to each other.  The user chooses 1 that they agree with most.  Submitter get’s 1 token for submitting, and another when there’s is chosen from the pool

*Flag*: How the system or a user can signal that something is not working correctly here.  These flags can trigger an investigation, or can be used by investigators to get more context when investigating someone that has reached the flag threshold required for a full investigation.

*Investigation*: If a user or course or any content in the list or pool recieves a flag from %5 of the userbase - a jury of investigators are incentivized to vote on if they should remove or not.  They can communicate via the app, but are given 1 week to complete the task.  Investigators can pass on this responsibility, but recieve a flag if they choose to do so and asked to give a reason.

*Categorization Engine*: The mechanism for finding Synchronicity in a group of insights.  User is free to pick amount of insights into a “block” and label it.  This label is put into the list to win the Insight Periodic Prize.  This is most comparable with Mining in POW systems.

*List*: the list of insight blocks that can be down and upvoted with extra tokens or even purchased tokens.  The purchasable tokens are the tokens raised in the initial coin offering, or possibly even just by the organization that is running the app. Their effect follows quadratic voting policies.

*Blessing*: A donation left to the app after a course is listened to.  Each author get’s to set their own ratio? Or possibly preset at 50% to publisher, 3% to App, 47% to IPP.

*Quadratic Voting*:  A mechanism for minimizing a voting token’s weight when applied in mass to achieve the greatest amount of consent and protects against majority rule by following a mathematical weighting rule for votes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting

*Prize*:  The incentive to submit insights or courses, as well as to vote on others’, and participate in general.  Prize is divided by primarily the one that creates, but also proportionate to how many people have voted on it relative to its winning.  
*Insight Periodic Prize*: A monetary prize that is rewarded monthly to be split among participants.  10% to author, 90% to all token holders that voted it up, proportionate to their tokens spent. 

*Course Periodic Prize*: A monetary prize that is rewarded monthly/quarterly to the top submitted courses.


## Persona Stories
### User
User hears about app that rewards users for meditating.  They signup, go through traditional app flow, nothing different than normal, at end they are asked to give an insight they gleaned from their meditation along with a blessing or donation.  If they choose not to, no worries, the continue to use the app as normal.

If choose to they are rewarded with 1 token for achieving the “first contribution” badge.
They can find out what this means by learning more, or just go on meditating as normal and forget all about it.

However, if they choose to, this token has unlocked the ability to vote on any insight, or course in order to take part in the IPP, or flag others through the app in order to gain more tokens or possibly financial bounty.

### Insight Collective
All the money donated after a session, we ask for “blessings”
They see a banner that says “Come, sit with us and win up to $1,534” If they want to submit an insight to be eligible for winning the prize, they must look through list of already entered and enter them as a pair.  This costs no tokens, this is purely for synchrisity.  

However, if one of the insights seems false, off, or harmful to the community the users can flag this comment.  This DOES cost 1 token, however, if it receives enough to trigger an *investigation* and it comes out that they are deemed innapropriate thee person that flagged get's a reward so might get 2 tokens back.  Verified flags against users don't have any immediate impact, more just a “reputation” score to show for later use.

The final insights that make it to the top of the list is given the entire reward.  25% going to the author, the rest going to everything that supported it.


### Instructor
Instructor wants to publish a course and make money and build community.  I sign up because 
- Existing Community
- Tooling (subscription & payments)
- Get voting rights in organization

I create a course that is validated by 5 random validators.  It get’s approved and I receive 1 voting token.  Proceeds from this course go to me but 10% goes to escrow account as fee.
At any point I can withdraw their tokens, taking out the equivalent of $ associated with the total in escrow.  

1 token of 100k tokens, withdraw $.1 of $10k escrow


## Attack Vectors

### POC
User just sets phone down, goes to sleep and are rewarded for 30 minutes of meditation
Require that users give “insight” within 30 seconds of ending. Something that impacted them.
	- Create Bot that does the same thing with meaningless insights Bounty for flagging accounts exists - which if found will ban the user.
  - Integrate in with head sensor machine to require actual brain wavelength sensing.
  - Take Picture — pictures will have AI detect if duplicates and if so - give to human to flag or deem good
  - Leave insight - other people will be presented with 4 options at finish - if pick yours both are rewarded 1 to choose 2 to author - POS - proof of synchrisity.  Winners are then put also into a queue that instructors can vote on the order of

### Collusion
- User finds out who the validators or jury members are and bribes / threatens / extorted them to vote a certain way.
Whistleblower rewards
  - No way to fully protect against this.
