### Overview
The general mechanism at play is that the token holds it's value as a ratio of the collective holdings and has a fee associated to withdraw. Thus has greater value **in** network, and rewards users to keep their money in network.

The short and sweet user story is that when a user meditates they recieve a [voice credit](#voice-credit) that they can use for various things through the app.  We hold compititions aproximately once a month to gain insights from the community and reward the users that create and interact with these insights.  In essense creating a win-win situation in which if everyone plays together, all will be rewarded -- but still leaves an open space for true market dynamics in which winners are sure to emerge.

The organization behind all of this starts centralized and as it matures automates all roles and responsibilities via smart contracts.  Now instead of a central body directing priorities and solutions, it provides incentives and allows the wisdom of the crowd to prevail.

This is revolutionary in the sense that current companies have 3 primary components -- owner, employee and consumer -- that don't have to be intertwined.  This new proposed model would enforce via code that in order to consume the material produced by the network, you would be willing to help curate and manage the material, and that you have a vested interest in the quality and longevity of the community itself. 

In essence this aims to take "crowd sourced" companies such as Uber, AirBnB or even YouTube to the next level, by making people partners and co-creators rather than terminating nodes in their hiarcy of power.  The part make the whole, and the whole doesn't exist without the parts. We are all connected.

### Assumptions
The initial funds, courses and audience needed to start are made available to us.  We‚Äôll assume a modest sum of a $10,946 endowment, 377 Guided Meditation audio files or 13 paid courses that already exist in the ecosystem.

Roles appointed to members rely on random selection at the moment of need from the entire pool of eligible users, in essence forming a type of Jury Duty to help protect and serve the organism.

All numbers, ratios and amounts in the examples below should be viewed as variables and subject to change.  Ideally being able to be adjusted dynamically by the group as the org grows and faces new challenges.

We will never be able to stop bad actors fully.  At the end of the day, it‚Äôs a system of humans and they can be threatened, bullied or bribed off-chain.  We accept this vulnerability the same way we accept the risk of existing in the world and seek to build the group with care.  For this reason the role of citizenship officer is very important.

There is a mechanism for attaching identities to users making civil attacks by bots hard to achieve.  A user could hypothetically have multiple accounts, but we hope through AI assistance of comparing photos to spot these duplicate accounts.

The persons that initially starts this group will not immediately decentralize it.  In order to move quickly and prove out different hypothesis the product will be built on a web 2.0 stack until the ecosystem is mature enough to support itself, at which point the persons will work on decentralizing the tech stack and all associated responsibilities.

### Personas


**Typical User Tom:**
User hears about app that rewards users for meditating.  They signup, go through traditional app flow, nothing different than normal, at end they are asked to give an insight they gleaned from their meditation along with a blessing or donation.  If they choose not to, no worries, they continue to use the app as normal.

If choose to they are rewarded with 1 token for achieving the ‚Äúfirst contribution‚Äù badge. They can find out what this means by learning more, or just go on meditating as normal and forget all about it.

*-- app wireframe here --*

If they choose to, this token has unlocked the ability to vote on any insight, or course in order to take part in the [PIP](#PIP), or [flag](#flag) others through the app in order to gain more tokens or possibly financial bounty.

### [œÄ](#pi) in the sky
Money for the [PIP](#PIP) comes from our [œÄ](#pi) account which is filled in various ways:

- Post meditation [blessings](#blessing)
- Paid courses
- Investors
- Promotions & Advertising (no vouchers given)

User sees a banner that says ‚ÄúCome, sit with us and win your part of $1,534‚Äù.  The amount in the [Periodic Insight Prize](#PIP) is determined at first by a board of members, but will eventually be a jury of validators.  

Anyone can enter by different mechanisms:

1) Submit an [insight](#insight) and group through the [SCE](#sce) process.
2) Stake additional tokens on other insight groups. 

However, if one of the insights seems false, off, or harmful to the community the users can flag this comment.  This does cost tokens, however, if it receives enough to trigger an [investigation](#investigation) and it comes out that they are deemed innapropriate the person that flagged get's a reward so might get 2 tokens back for every 1 they flagged with.  Verified flags against users don't have any immediate impact, more just a ‚Äúreputation‚Äù type score to show for later use.

**Rewards**
The final insight that make it to the top of the list is given the [PIP](#PIP) to split among it's supporters.  For example, the 1,000 USD on an insight with 2 (a)uthors, and 3 (s)takers at 60%, 30%, 10% respectively would recieve. `$100` a1 & a2, `$480` s1, `$240` s2, `$80` s3.

The top half are rewarded with the bottom half's staked tokens also proportionate to their voting weights.

One could say this system is easily gamed, however voice credits cannot be bought, they must be earned through service to the organism or through meditation. So it creates an irresistable draw to be involved or meditate repeatedly in order to gain more tokens, which in turn give the platform more habitual repeat users and better marketability to sell to [appropriate advertising](#aa).

In essence we gamify meditation, not just with badges but by actual incentives tied to USD. This binds financial and emotional well being together in a new and explosive way.

### Definitions
<strong id="poc">PoC:</strong> Proof of Consciousness

<strong id="insight">Insight:</strong> a tweet sized text -- to be expanded to audio/video when applicable. The "stake" given by it's author at time of creation will determine it's place in the rankings. 

<strong id="ig">Insight Group:</strong> a group of insights put together in via the [Synchronicity Categorization Engine](#sce) 

<strong id="vc">Voice Credit:</strong> a voting token within the organism, used to reward certain activities and used to stake on PIP.  These are not transferable.

<strong id="voucher">Voucher:</strong> Anytime money is given to the organism, a voucher token is also given.  Vouchers can be burned at anytime, releasing their underlying value in proportion to how much is in the Pie.

<strong id="exit-fee">Exit Fee:</strong> A percentage paid to the org for cashing out your tokens.  For instance if your vouchers represent 10% of the outstanding tokens, and the exit fee is 3.14% then on burning all your tokens with a [œÄ](#pi) of 1,000 USD  would result in recieving 6.86% or 686 USD. The extra 314 USD going to the existing users incentivizing people to not withdraw.

<strong id="meditation">Meditation:</strong> an audio file meant to be consumed during meditation.  Free to submit, but if want to enter into competition to win and be featured, then needs to form group and stake vouchers or voice credits. If [flagged](#flag) and found obscene, will lose tokens.  The staked amount determines it's place in the [list](#list) - making more highly staked courses more likely to be seen. 

<strong id="pool">Pool:</strong> Where all insights and respectively meditations go in order to be selected by peers.

<strong id="pi">œÄ (pi):</strong> A shared multi-sig wallet where the organism's assets are held. The goal is a small piece of a bigger Pi. Payouts for [vouchers](#vouchers) and [proposals](#proposals) come from here.

<strong id="flag">Flag</strong>: How the system or a user can signal that something is not working correctly here.  These flags can trigger an investigation, or can be used by investigators to get more context when investigating someone that has reached the flag threshold required for a full investigation.

<strong id="investigation">Investigation</strong>: If a user or course or any content in the list or pool recieves a flag from %5 of the userbase - a jury of investigators are incentivized to vote on if they should remove or not.  They can communicate via the app, but are given 1 week to complete the task.  Investigators can pass on this responsibility, but recieve a flag if they choose to do so and asked to give a reason.

<strong id="sce">Synchronicity Categorization Engine</strong>: The mechanism for finding Synchronicity in a group of [insights](#insight).  User is free to place 2-10 insights into a ‚Äúblock‚Äù and label it.  This label is put into the list to win the Insight Periodic Prize. This costs no tokens, this is purely for synchrisity and network / team building within the app.

<strong id="list">List</strong>: the list of insight blocks that can be down and upvoted with extra tokens or even purchased tokens.  The purchasable tokens are the tokens raised in the initial coin offering, or possibly even just by the organization that is running the app. Their effect follows quadratic voting policies.

<strong id="blessing">Blessing</strong>: A donation left to the app after a course is listened to.  Each author get‚Äôs to set their own ratio? Or possibly preset at 50% to publisher, 3% to App, 47% to PIP.

<strong id="QV">Quadratic Voting</strong>:  A mechanism for minimizing a voting token‚Äôs weight when applied in mass to achieve the greatest amount of consent and protects against majority rule by following a mathematical weighting rule for votes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting

<strong id="prize">Prize</strong>:  The incentive to submit insights or courses, as well as to vote on others‚Äô, and participate in general.  Prize is divided by primarily the one that creates, but also proportionate to how many people have voted on it relative to its winning.

<strong id="PIP">Insight Periodic Prize</strong>: A monetary prize that is rewarded on a lunar cycle to be split among participants.  10% to author, 90% to all token holders that voted it up, proportionate to their tokens spent. 

<strong id="CPP">Course Periodic Prize</strong>: A monetary prize that is rewarded quarterly to the top submitted courses.

<strong id="aa">Appropriate Advertising</strong>: Advertising for other organizations that are appropriate.  We would not want to allow google adwords for instance, because we do not know who will appear.  I'd look to [BAT](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) tokens to explore a way to reward our user's with Basic Attention Tokens and take advantage of that ecosystem.

### Attack Vectors

##### POC
User just sets phone down, goes to sleep and are rewarded for 30 minutes of meditation
Require that users give ‚Äúinsight‚Äù within 30 seconds of ending. Something that impacted them.
	- Create Bot that does the same thing with meaningless insights Bounty for flagging accounts exists - which if found will ban the user.
  - Integrate in with head sensor machine to require actual brain wavelength sensing.
  - Take Picture ‚Äî pictures will have AI detect if duplicates and if so - give to human to flag or deem good
  - Leave insight - other people will be presented with 4 options at finish - if pick yours both are rewarded 1 to choose 2 to author - POS - proof of synchrisity.  Winners are then put also into a queue that instructors can vote on the order of

##### Collusion
- User finds out who the validators or jury members are and bribes / threatens / extorted them to vote a certain way.
Whistleblower rewards
  - No way to fully protect against this.
